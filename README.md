# winequality_study
In this project, we will be looking at physicochemical properties of red wine, we will find out how various factors influence the quality of the wine and also find out if there is any realtionship between the factors present.

INFERENCES:
During this analysis project we found the following things: 
A. Univariate Analysis: 
  1. Fixed acidity and Volatile acidity are positively skewed distributions but Citric Acid gives an edge peak distribution. 
  2. Most wines have a low residual sugar concentration(also positively skewed).
  3. The most frequent chlorine concentration can be found around 0.04-0.05 g/L. 
  4.About one-fourth of the total sulfur dioxide occurs in the form of free sulfur dioxide.
  5. Most wines have sulfate concentration near 0.5g/L. 6. Generally, wines have alcohol content between 8-10 vol%.
  
B. Bivariate Analysis:
  1. Wines with higher alcohol percentage tend to have higher quality score.
  2. There is a negative correlation between Volatile Acidity and Quality.
  3. There is a negative correlation between Alcohol Content and Density.
  4.There is a positive correlation between Residual Sugar and Density.

CONCLUSIONS:
In this analysis task, we did two type of analysis, univariate and bivariate analysis, in the first we looked at variations in
parameters one by one and in the later we looked at how these parameters were affecting each other plus how they
determined the wine quality. It is astonishing that wine quality is not that strongly affected by any of the given parameters. We
found medium to weak correlations between quality and density, alcohol content, volatile acidity and chloride concentration. 
                                     In my opinion, we need to find more parameters that significantly influence the quality of wine, because according to this dataset
it was more dependent on the personal taste of the person rating the wine. We should explore things like the type of grape used, the time when the wine was made, the taste of the wine based on environmental conditions like heat and humidity.
